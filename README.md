# Rust Profiler

This is an experimental attempt for me to understand the architecture of a profiler by implementing some features in Rust. A goal for this project is to be able to output the profile format for the Firefox Profiler.

## Running the code

Right now things mostly work through running the tests. This can be done through running the bash script. I did a bash script to be able to configure the test command a bit. Perhaps there is a more elegant way to do this in the future. There is also a single example.

```
./test.sh
./example.sh output-json
```
